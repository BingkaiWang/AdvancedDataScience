This is a role that will have significant exposure to the entire executive team. We will look to you to help us understand our data improve our decisions. To be successful in this role, you must be self-motivated, driven and able to help the team in whatever way necessary including hands-on development.This is that dream role at a start-up you've been looking for - all the passion and growth, lots of up-side but without having to eat ramen 3 meals a day. This isn't a photo sharing app - people are quitting their jobs and realizing their dreams on Cratejoy. It's real, it really matters - and it's unbelievably fulfilling.In this role, you will:Discover data sources, get access to them, import them, clean them up, and make them ""model-ready"". You need to be willing and able to do your own SQL database work.Perform hands-on data analysis and modeling with large data sets.Collaborate with CEO and Director of Finance to identify critical business problems and translate business questions into technical analyses.Interact with business leaders to understand business strategy, conditions and problem areas.Produce actionable and compelling recommendations by interpreting, exploring, identifying and communicating insights discovered from complex data sets.Create and refine features from the underlying data. You'll enjoy developing just enough subject matter expertise to have an intuition about what features might make your model perform better, and then you'll lather, rinse and repeat.Construct predictive models, algorithms and probability engines; verify model and algorithm effectiveness based on actual results.Qualifications:MS or PHD in Math or related field with 2-5+ years of experience in data science.Deep knowledge of information retrieval, data mining, statistics, or related field.Solid programming skills that enable them to retrieve, analyze and process data, and build models from the ground up (SQL, Python, R, Java, Scala).Ability to effectively communicate, both verbally and in writing.Mine and analyze data to measure, understand, and predict customer behavior, sales team performance, yield management, web traffic patterns.Who we want to work with:We want to work with people who want to work at Cratejoy, not just people who are looking for their next job. They specifically have sought out Cratejoy, they understand what our company does and they feel some sort of affinity with the mission. They are hungry for knowledge and are looking to be challenged in new ways, perhaps they even aspire to start their own business one day - or maybe they already have and now they want to know how to start a high impact business next time. They obviously care about compensation but they aren’t just looking for the next higher title and a little pay bump from their current job. They are leaving their current company after making some sort of impact, rather than because they just seem to leave jobs every 18 months once they realize it wasn’t as exciting as they thought it would be.They seem to be aware of who they are as a person, including their own weaknesses, and want the sort of direct feedback and coaching it takes to grow their skillset, into a better team member, and even into a better person. In general people they worked with in the past would say that they are the type of person that “seems to make everything a little bit better” and that adding them to any conversation made the conversation more interesting, rather than more frustrating.They respect their peers and want to learn more from those around them, and they give people the benefit of the doubt. They don’t rush to condemn people and they don’t quietly judge, they seek to help their peers be their best. They don’t like to assign blame, but if they were to assign blame they’d be just as likely to assign it to themselves as anyone else.They are hard working when they have a mission, but they aren’t just aimlessly working tons of hours for no particular reason. They care a lot about what it is that they are doing, and they don’t just blindly follow direction. They want and need to understand how their work connects with the mission of the company and once they do they take it on as their own mission in life. When looking to solve problems they are willing to go outside themselves, but only after doing the diligence necessary. They don’t like to waste anyone's time - least of all their own.They are quick to admit mistakes, and they don’t let ego leave them on the wrong side of an issue for very long (or very often). In their area of primary skillset they are very strong in it. They may have other weaknesses, which is okay as long as they are aware of them, but there is at least one or two things at which they are indisputably A+.About Cratejoy:Cratejoy is the one-stop destination for all things subscription box. Where you subscribe to what you love, and sell what you’re passionate aboutWe’re a Y Combinator and Capital Factory company and have raised a series A from CRV in California. We’re very well funded and have been growing at a staggering rate every single month since launch. Cratejoy’s growth is rocket ship fast, and we’d love for you to be a big part of it.Our aim is to make subscription as accessible as eBay or Etsy make ecommerce today. Our vision is to bring the best business model in the universe to everyone on the planet.There’s 3 pieces to that vision:The first was our subscription commerce platform. Our seller tools. There was no consensus for how to run a subscription business. We had to design those tools and build them. We had to do it in a way that is accessible to average online merchant. If they were savvy enough to run an etsy store they should be more than savvy enough to run a cratejoy subscription.The next piece was education. There really were no resources that taught merchants how to run a subscription business. We built subscription school which is a free education site we run. Our team has deep subscription commerce expertise. We write articles, post videos and host webinars to teach people how to run subscription businesses. We created a forum which puts merchants in an community where they support each other and learn together. In the space of a year we’ve become the unrivaled thought leaders inside of subscription commerce.Finally, we’ve built the marketplace. This is a consumer destination site that sells subscriptions. Consumers arrive at Cratejoy and subscribe to our merchants. We cross-sell additional subscriptions to them. This is the piece that we wanted to get to. By creating the platform we were aggregating supply for the marketplace. The marketplace is the demand side of the equation. And the whole is bigger than the sum of the parts, these all tie back together to build the virtuous cycle that is the Cratejoy ecosystem.FAQ:How much have you raised? $11M in VC from the best investors in the worldDo you have revenue?
