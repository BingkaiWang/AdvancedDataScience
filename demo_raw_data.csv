This role is viewed as an expert in making sense of complex data environments, encompassing both business data and process understanding and technical expertise.

A data scientist must be able to use data to tell stories. Key components of these communication skills are those of persuasion and expectation management. The ability to insert themselves into core business functions and assert their ideas is therefore critical.Collaboration: Working directly for business leaders and side-by-side with business unit personnel, they need to shed the introverted statistician stereotype. Increasingly, business professionals require access to analytic techniques beyond basic math and must be able to rely on the data scientist to work closely with them. The data scientist enables the broad consumerization of derivative result sets and analytics (if not the raw data). The data scientist must have the ability to juggle competing priorities and pressures.Leadership. The role of the data scientist can incorporate data oversight responsibilities including directing the efforts of teams of consultant statisticians, data administration and integration professionals, and data visualization, reporting, and application integration developers.Creativity. The work of the data scientist is very much an innovation-oriented exercise in solving open-ended conundrums. Data scientists are tasked with finding opportunities to optimize, expand or transform the business through the lens of information. Moreover, data scientists must be creative in sourcing data, modeling problems and employing a range of analytic techniques.Discipline. Although creativity is critical, data scientists must remember that \""science\"" is part of their directive. This means following established scientific methods, employing legitimate techniques, using valid data and embracing causality. Scientific methods demand that questions are well-defined, true data (observations) is collected, and hypotheses are formed, investigative methods are selected, data is analyzed and interpreted with yielding conclusions, and results are formally communicated and tested. Although rigid methodology is recommended, results perfection is not. Business opportunity costs in a fast-paced marketplace are too high to spend excessive time achieving incrementally better analyses. However, a data scientist — just as any good statistician or other analytics professional — must understand the differences between correlation and causality and between incidental and insightful patterns.Passion: An obsession for information, solving insurmountable problems and finding unique ways to accelerate the business.Consultancy: Manages provision of specialist knowledge over a range of topics in data science including the role of IT in the business; in own areas of expertise provides advice and guidance influencing the effectiveness of the organization’s business processes.Data Design: Controls analytics data design practice within the enterprise. Influences industry-based models for the development of new technology applications. Develops effective implementation and procurement strategies, consistent with business needs.Data Analysis: Sets standards for advanced analytics tool usage and techniques, advises on their application, and ensures compliance. Manages the investigation of corporate data requirements, and co-ordinates the application of data analysis and analytics techniques, based upon a detailed understanding of the corporate information requirements, in order to establish, modify or maintain analytical models and their associated components.Autonomy: Has authority and responsibility for all aspects of data science, including policy formation and application. Is fully accountable for actions taken and decisions made, both by self and subordinates.Influence: Makes decisions critical to organizational success. Influences developments within the IT industry at the highest levels. Advances the knowledge and/or exploitation of IT within one or more organizations. Develops long-term strategic relationships with customers, partners, industry leaders and government.Complexity: Performs highly complex work activities covering technical, financial and quality aspects.
