This is a role that will have significant exposure to the entire executive team. We will look to you to help us understand our data improve our decisions. To be successful in this role, you must be self-motivated, driven and able to help the team in whatever way necessary including hands-on development.This is that dream role at a start-up you've been looking for - all the passion and growth, lots of up-side but without having to eat ramen 3 meals a day. This isn't a photo sharing app - people are quitting their jobs and realizing their dreams on Cratejoy. It's real, it really matters - and it's unbelievably fulfilling.In this role, you will:Discover data sources, get access to them, import them, clean them up, and make them ""model-ready"". You need to be willing and able to do your own SQL database work.Perform hands-on data analysis and modeling with large data sets.Collaborate with CEO and Director of Finance to identify critical business problems and translate business questions into technical analyses.Interact with business leaders to understand business strategy, conditions and problem areas.Produce actionable and compelling recommendations by interpreting, exploring, identifying and communicating insights discovered from complex data sets.Create and refine features from the underlying data. You'll enjoy developing just enough subject matter expertise to have an intuition about what features might make your model perform better, and then you'll lather, rinse and repeat.Construct predictive models, algorithms and probability engines; verify model and algorithm effectiveness based on actual results.Qualifications:MS or PHD in Math or related field with 2-5+ years of experience in data science.Deep knowledge of information retrieval, data mining, statistics, or related field.Solid programming skills that enable them to retrieve, analyze and process data, and build models from the ground up (SQL, Python, R, Java, Scala).Ability to effectively communicate, both verbally and in writing.Mine and analyze data to measure, understand, and predict customer behavior, sales team performance, yield management, web traffic patterns.Who we want to work with:We want to work with people who want to work at Cratejoy, not just people who are looking for their next job. They specifically have sought out Cratejoy, they understand what our company does and they feel some sort of affinity with the mission. They are hungry for knowledge and are looking to be challenged in new ways, perhaps they even aspire to start their own business one day - or maybe they already have and now they want to know how to start a high impact business next time. They obviously care about compensation but they aren’t just looking for the next higher title and a little pay bump from their current job. They are leaving their current company after making some sort of impact, rather than because they just seem to leave jobs every 18 months once they realize it wasn’t as exciting as they thought it would be.They seem to be aware of who they are as a person, including their own weaknesses, and want the sort of direct feedback and coaching it takes to grow their skillset, into a better team member, and even into a better person. In general people they worked with in the past would say that they are the type of person that “seems to make everything a little bit better” and that adding them to any conversation made the conversation more interesting, rather than more frustrating.They respect their peers and want to learn more from those around them, and they give people the benefit of the doubt. They don’t rush to condemn people and they don’t quietly judge, they seek to help their peers be their best. They don’t like to assign blame, but if they were to assign blame they’d be just as likely to assign it to themselves as anyone else.They are hard working when they have a mission, but they aren’t just aimlessly working tons of hours for no particular reason. They care a lot about what it is that they are doing, and they don’t just blindly follow direction. They want and need to understand how their work connects with the mission of the company and once they do they take it on as their own mission in life. When looking to solve problems they are willing to go outside themselves, but only after doing the diligence necessary. They don’t like to waste anyone's time - least of all their own.They are quick to admit mistakes, and they don’t let ego leave them on the wrong side of an issue for very long (or very often). In their area of primary skillset they are very strong in it. They may have other weaknesses, which is okay as long as they are aware of them, but there is at least one or two things at which they are indisputably A+.About Cratejoy:Cratejoy is the one-stop destination for all things subscription box. Where you subscribe to what you love, and sell what you’re passionate aboutWe’re a Y Combinator and Capital Factory company and have raised a series A from CRV in California. We’re very well funded and have been growing at a staggering rate every single month since launch. Cratejoy’s growth is rocket ship fast, and we’d love for you to be a big part of it.Our aim is to make subscription as accessible as eBay or Etsy make ecommerce today. Our vision is to bring the best business model in the universe to everyone on the planet.There’s 3 pieces to that vision:The first was our subscription commerce platform. Our seller tools. There was no consensus for how to run a subscription business. We had to design those tools and build them. We had to do it in a way that is accessible to average online merchant. If they were savvy enough to run an etsy store they should be more than savvy enough to run a cratejoy subscription.The next piece was education. There really were no resources that taught merchants how to run a subscription business. We built subscription school which is a free education site we run. Our team has deep subscription commerce expertise. We write articles, post videos and host webinars to teach people how to run subscription businesses. We created a forum which puts merchants in an community where they support each other and learn together. In the space of a year we’ve become the unrivaled thought leaders inside of subscription commerce.Finally, we’ve built the marketplace. This is a consumer destination site that sells subscriptions. Consumers arrive at Cratejoy and subscribe to our merchants. We cross-sell additional subscriptions to them. This is the piece that we wanted to get to. By creating the platform we were aggregating supply for the marketplace. The marketplace is the demand side of the equation.

They specifically have sought out Cratejoy, they understand what our company does and they feel some sort of affinity with the mission. They are hungry for knowledge and are looking to be challenged in new ways, perhaps they even aspire to start their own business one day - or maybe they already have and now they want to know how to start a high impact business next time. They obviously care about compensation but they aren't just looking for the next higher title and a little pay bump from their current job. They are leaving their current company after making some sort of impact, rather than because they just seem to leave jobs every 18 months once they realize it wasn't as exciting as they thought it would be. They seem to be aware of who they are as a person, including their own weaknesses, and want the sort of direct feedback and coaching it takes to grow their skillset, into a better team member, and even into a better person. In general people they worked with in the past would say that they are the type of person that ""seems to make everything a little bit better"" and that adding them to any conversation made the conversation more interesting, rather than more frustrating.  They respect their peers and want to learn more from those around them, and they give people the benefit of the doubt. They don't rush to condemn people and they don't quietly judge, they seek to help their peers be their best. They don't like to assign blame, but if they were to assign blame they'd be just as likely to assign it to themselves as anyone else.  They are hard working when they have a mission, but they aren't just aimlessly working tons of hours for no particular reason. They care a lot about what it is that they are doing, and they don't just blindly follow direction. They want and need to understand how their work connects with the mission of the company and once they do they take it on as their own mission in life. When looking to solve problems they are willing to go outside themselves, but only after doing the diligence necessary. They don't like to waste anyone's time - least of all their own.They are quick to admit mistakes, and they don't let ego leave them on the wrong side of an issue for very long (or very often). In their area of primary skillset they are very strong in it. They may have other weaknesses, which is okay as long as they are aware of them, but there is at least one or two things at which they are indisputably A+. About Cratejoy:Cratejoy is the one-stop destination for all things subscription box. Where you subscribe to what you love, and sell what you're passionate about We're a Y Combinator and Capital Factory company and have raised a series A from CRV in California. We're very well funded and have been growing at a staggering rate every single month since launch. Cratejoy's growth is rocket ship fast, and we'd love for you to be a big part of it.  Our aim is to make subscription as accessible as eBay or Etsy make ecommerce today. Our vision is to bring the best business model in the universe to everyone on the planet. There's 3 pieces to that vision: The first was our subscription commerce platform. Our seller tools. There was no consensus for how to run a subscription business. We had to design those tools and build them. We had to do it in a way that is accessible to average online merchant. If they were savvy enough to run an etsy store they should be more than savvy enough to run a cratejoy subscription.  The next piece was education. There really were no resources that taught merchants how to run a subscription business. We built subscription school which is a free education site we run. Our team has deep subscription commerce expertise. We write articles, post videos and host webinars to teach people how to run subscription businesses. We created a forum which puts merchants in an community where they support each other and learn together. In the space of a year we've become the unrivaled thought leaders inside of subscription commerce.  Finally, we've built the marketplace. This is a consumer destination site that sells subscriptions. Consumers arrive at Cratejoy and subscribe to our merchants. We cross-sell additional subscriptions to them. This is the piece that we wanted to get to. By creating the platform we were aggregating supply for the marketplace. The marketplace is the demand side of the equation. And the whole is bigger than the sum of the parts, these all tie back together to build the virtuous cycle that is the Cratejoy ecosystem.

To do that we are building the best data science team in the world to generate actionable intelligence from millions of satellite and aerial images. Current members come from backgrounds including evolutionary biology, geophysics, neuroscience and astrophysics.We are data detectives and the job is difficult because although we have Big Data, we exist in a persistent state of spatio-temporal data starvation. The work is fast-paced, highly iterative, and continuously trading off between what works and whats best. Before we even start analyzing real world data we typically build simulations to inform our models and approaches. The actual data analysis typically goes from computer vision to mathematical modeling to validation with rigorous testing at every step of the way.Along with our team of data scientists, youll work with product managers, sales, and engineers to build data-driven products and solutions. If you enjoy working with data to build products and solve hard problems in creative ways, you will fit right in.The world is a very big place. With a single photograph of Earth, like the famous ""Blue Marble"" from Apollo 17, the entire world can fit on a computer screen. However, with this image you would not be able to see much detail. To see the Earth and all of its rich features, you would need a lot more images. In fact it would take over 500 million images just to observe the land area of Earth at 1 meter pixel resolution.In order to see detail and work at scale, we use computer vision and machine learning. Using convolutional neural networks, we have counted over 3 billion cars across global roads and parking lots, analyzing commercial patterns as well as city growth and development. Our global energy product uses computer vision to map floating roof oil tanks and measure the global volumes of crude oil. With this product, we were able to show that China has 200 million barrels of oil storage capacity that was unknown even to the trading community. Other projects include tracking rates of deforestation, measuring poverty levels around the globe, monitoring construction rates of new roads and buildings, and predicting crop yields.

"371","Orbital Insight",4.9,"$106k-$152k","Mountain View","CA"," Data Scientist  Our mission is to understand the Earth, including all of the economic and social trends impacting us. To do that we are building the best data science team in the world to generate actionable intelligence from millions of satellite and aerial images. Current members come from backgrounds including evolutionary biology, geophysics, neuroscience and astrophysics.  We are data detectives and the job is difficult because although we have Big Data, we exist in a persistent state of spatio-temporal data starvation. The work is fast-paced, highly iterative, and continuously trading off between what works and what's best. Before we even start analyzing real world data we typically build simulations to inform our models and approaches. The actual data analysis typically goes from computer vision to mathematical modeling to validation with rigorous testing at every step of the way.  Along with our team of data scientists, you'll work with product managers, sales, and engineers to build data-driven products and solutions. If you enjoy working with data to build products and solve hard problems in creative ways, you will fit right in.  The world is a very big place. With a single photograph of Earth, like the famous ""Blue Marble"" from Apollo 17, the entire world can fit on a computer screen. However, with this image you would not be able to see much detail. To see the Earth and all of its rich features, you would need a lot more images. In fact it would take over 500 million images just to observe the land area of Earth at 1 meter pixel resolution.  In order to see detail and work at scale, we use computer vision and machine learning. Using convolutional neural networks, we have counted over 3 billion cars across global roads and parking lots, analyzing commercial patterns as well as city growth and development. Our global energy product uses computer vision to map floating roof oil tanks and measure the global volumes of crude oil. With this product, we were able to show that China has 200 million barrels of oil storage capacity that was unknown even to the trading community. Other projects include tracking rates of deforestation, measuring poverty levels around the globe, monitoring construction rates of new roads and buildings, and predicting crop yields. This is still the beginning of our mission to understand the Earth.  This position will be based in our Mountain View, CA office.  Job Purpose  Owning the exploration and application of any data and approach that will help us build products that represent actual value to our customers.  Job Duties Research and model real world systems and behavior based on actual observationsHelp develop (large-scale) simulations to assess a new product's complexity, yield, and feasibilityConceive of and implement experiments to test hypotheses regarding (statistical) behavior of data/models/productsHelp develop training and cross-validation data sets for machine learning algorithmsTranslate product management, engineering, and business constraints and queries into tractable data science questionsIterate rapidly on everything; all of the above happens in a relatively fast paced business driven environment, you must be comfortable with that.Develop and evangelize our data science knowledge base Skills & Qualifications PhD, or equivalent experience in Statistics, Machine Learning, Economics, Econometrics or fields with heavy focus on these disciplines.Minimum three years of demonstrable practical experience working with large and noisy datasets that are nevertheless sparse in some way.Superb communication skills. This is often added to job requirements as an afterthought. We actually mean it. You'll need to be able to explain yourself and your methods both within the company and with customers.Excellent data analysis & visualization skills in Python or R, preferably both.Strong Unix/Linux skills We are backed by marquee investors such as Sequoia Capital, Google Ventures, In-Q-Tel, and Bloomberg Beta, Orbital Insight is rapidly expanding its commercial and public sector capabilities. Come join us if you are unafraid to try new approaches and relentlessly seek to push the state of the art, taking projects all the way from prototype to production-ready.

Some are stuck in screening for 48-72 hours once a manger realizes they dropped the ball they send additional questions (ones you have answered in the many forms you fill up to that point) in what seems asaway to buy time or for lack of a better term CYA. The second and sad thing is when you candidate has a request for interviews and the mangers alert you of this weeks later only for you to see the request was made much earlier. Another is when you candidate is flaking and you don't feel this person will accept the position mangers force you to pressure thecandiate to taking the interview even though the candidate expressed they are no longer interested. Submission to placement is very which will equal low commissions and for some odd reason the recruiter is blamed for this.Another issue is the ethical and moral delinquency. Managers use personal information gained through false sense of comfort and comraderie against employees which lowers moral and creates a hostile and paranoid teamAdvice to ManagementPlease evaluate your middle management. Red flags are everywhere ! If middle management used as much effort as they did in covering their behinds and providing recruiters as sacrificial lambs into growing their teams and accounts the company would be amazing to work for and certain teams would not be floundering. Evaluate certain teams and turn over rates and performance Really dig into these managers . Also emphasize the moral ,ethical and legal repercussions of breaching confidence.When an employee is told they cannot know the reason they were let go but it was no reason, make sure managers are not telling others why ( because the reason was illegal, immoral and non compliant to EEOC ) Epitec 2017-10-08 08:43 PDT See All 180 ReviewsGet email updates for jobs like this:Job Title or KeywordsLocationEnter Email AddressCreate AlertCreatingOne more step! Please check your email to activate the job alert.Epitec PhotosSee All PhotosSee AllView Allnum of numClose (Esc)Interested in a New Job?Upload a resume to mobile apply.

They talk the talk but do not walk the walk whatsoever . In such a fast paced competitive field you would think your managers main priority would be forwarding candidates to the hiring managers and following up to spotlight these candidates and keep momentum going. As a recruiter , a good recruiter you have a do it know mentality unfortunately this ball stops rolling on the management end . It seems like things die as soon as you identify a candidate. Some are stuck in screening for 48-72 hours once a manger realizes they dropped the ball they send additional questions (ones you have answered in the many forms you fill up to that point) in what seems asaway to buy time or for lack of a better term CYA. The second and sad thing is when you candidate has a request for interviews and the mangers alert you of this weeks later only for you to see the request was made much earlier. Another is when you candidate is flaking and you don't feel this person will accept the position mangers force you to pressure thecandiate to taking the interview even though the candidate expressed they are no longer interested. Submission to placement is very which will equal low commissions and for some odd reason the recruiter is blamed for this.Another issue is the ethical and moral delinquency. Managers use personal information gained through false sense of comfort and comraderie against employees which lowers moral and creates a hostile and paranoid teamAdvice to ManagementPlease evaluate your middle management. Red flags are everywhere ! If middle management used as much effort as they did in covering their behinds and providing recruiters as sacrificial lambs into growing their teams and accounts the company would be amazing to work for and certain teams would not be floundering. Evaluate certain teams and turn over rates and performance Really dig into these managers . Also emphasize the moral ,ethical and legal repercussions of breaching confidence.When an employee is told they cannot know the reason they were let go but it was no reason, make sure managers are not telling others why ( because the reason was illegal, immoral and non compliant to EEOC ) Epitec 2017-10-08 08:43 PDT See All 180 ReviewsGet email updates for jobs like this:Job Title or KeywordsLocationEnter Email AddressCreate AlertCreatingOne more step! Please check your email to activate the job alert.Epitec PhotosSee All PhotosSee AllView Allnum of numClose (Esc)Interested in a New Job?Upload a resume to mobile apply.","501-1000","Staffing & Outsourcing"

The data scientist will report to our VP of Brand Marketing as well as support projects across our sales, marketing and partner organizations collaborating across these and our engineering departments, to deliver the following: Marketing Lead & Sales Optimization Products to Improve Follow-up Efficiency - In collaboration with the Sales Operations team, the Data Scientist will design algorithms that help our Senior Living Advisors follow up with the right families at the right time. This project involves writing prediction algorithms that balance accuracy with human interpretability. It also involves designing experiments to test the impact of competing algorithms on customer success relative to each other and a control group. Going forward, future projects will include all phases of our sales funnel. Senior Living Cost Index - A Place for Mom built the public-facing Senior Living Cost Index to help families understand the median cost of different types of senior housing and care in over 3,000 cities in America. The tool is driven by a set of hedonic pricing models (based on individual-level senior housing and care transactions plus socio-demographic and geographic data) and repeat-sales models of price growth. The Data Scientist will continuously improve these models, communicating their results to the public and to reporters via press interviews. The Data Scientist will also work with designers to improve the user interface for the tool.

A data scientist must be able to use data to tell stories. Key components of these communication skills are those of persuasion and expectation management. The ability to insert themselves into core business functions and assert their ideas is therefore critical.Collaboration: Working directly for business leaders and side-by-side with business unit personnel, they need to shed the introverted statistician stereotype. Increasingly, business professionals require access to analytic techniques beyond basic math and must be able to rely on the data scientist to work closely with them. The data scientist enables the broad consumerization of derivative result sets and analytics (if not the raw data). The data scientist must have the ability to juggle competing priorities and pressures.Leadership. The role of the data scientist can incorporate data oversight responsibilities including directing the efforts of teams of consultant statisticians, data administration and integration professionals, and data visualization, reporting, and application integration developers.Creativity. The work of the data scientist is very much an innovation-oriented exercise in solving open-ended conundrums. Data scientists are tasked with finding opportunities to optimize, expand or transform the business through the lens of information. Moreover, data scientists must be creative in sourcing data, modeling problems and employing a range of analytic techniques.Discipline. Although creativity is critical, data scientists must remember that \""science\"" is part of their directive. This means following established scientific methods, employing legitimate techniques, using valid data and embracing causality. Scientific methods demand that questions are well-defined, true data (observations) is collected, and hypotheses are formed, investigative methods are selected, data is analyzed and interpreted with yielding conclusions, and results are formally communicated and tested. Although rigid methodology is recommended, results perfection is not. Business opportunity costs in a fast-paced marketplace are too high to spend excessive time achieving incrementally better analyses. However, a data scientist — just as any good statistician or other analytics professional — must understand the differences between correlation and causality and between incidental and insightful patterns.Passion: An obsession for information, solving insurmountable problems and finding unique ways to accelerate the business.Consultancy: Manages provision of specialist knowledge over a range of topics in data science including the role of IT in the business; in own areas of expertise provides advice and guidance influencing the effectiveness of the organization’s business processes.Data Design: Controls analytics data design practice within the enterprise.

Is fully accountable for actions taken and decisions made, both by self and subordinates.Influence: Makes decisions critical to organizational success. Influences developments within the IT industry at the highest levels. Advances the knowledge and/or exploitation of IT within one or more organizations.

They talk the talk but do not walk the walk whatsoever . In such a fast paced competitive field you would think your managers main priority would be forwarding candidates to the hiring managers and following up to spotlight these candidates and keep momentum going. As a recruiter , a good recruiter you have a do it know mentality unfortunately this ball stops rolling on the management end . It seems like things die as soon as you identify a candidate. Some are stuck in screening for 48-72 hours once a manger realizes they dropped the ball they send additional questions (ones you have answered in the many forms you fill up to that point) in what seems asaway to buy time or for lack of a better term CYA. The second and sad thing is when you candidate has a request for interviews and the mangers alert you of this weeks later only for you to see the request was made much earlier. Another is when you candidate is flaking and you don't feel this person will accept the position mangers force you to pressure thecandiate to taking the interview even though the candidate expressed they are no longer interested. Submission to placement is very which will equal low commissions and for some odd reason the recruiter is blamed for this.Another issue is the ethical and moral delinquency. Managers use personal information gained through false sense of comfort and comraderie against employees which lowers moral and creates a hostile and paranoid teamAdvice to ManagementPlease evaluate your middle management. Red flags are everywhere ! If middle management used as much effort as they did in covering their behinds and providing recruiters as sacrificial lambs into growing their teams and accounts the company would be amazing to work for and certain teams would not be floundering. Evaluate certain teams and turn over rates and performance Really dig into these managers . Also emphasize the moral ,ethical and legal repercussions of breaching confidence.When an employee is told they cannot know the reason they were let go but it was no reason, make sure managers are not telling others why ( because the reason was illegal, immoral and non compliant to EEOC ) Epitec 2017-10-08 08:43 PDT See All 180 ReviewsGet email updates for jobs like this:Job Title or KeywordsLocationEnter Email AddressCreate AlertCreatingOne more step! Please check your email to activate the job alert.Epitec PhotosSee All PhotosSee AllView Allnum of numClose (Esc)Interested in a New Job?Upload a resume to mobile apply.
